# Digital-Design-Project
The aim of this project is to implement a simple calculator to BASYS3. The calculator can operate four different calculations: adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing and inputs of this calculator is 8-bit signed numbers which means the most significant bit of the binary number states the sign. In order to satisfy the requirements of the calculator, HLSM logic is used to determine separate states of calculator such as the type of the operand and the view of seven-segment display (result of the operation is blinking in every 500 milliseconds). To implement the calculator to hardware, BASYS3 is used. Switches and leds are representing two 8-bit inputs while buttons are executing the operations and resetting the result when pushed. The result is displayed with seven-segment display whereas default segments are displaying 0000. Results are displayed as hexadecimal numbers
